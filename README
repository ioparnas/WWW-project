Project 4

I used the struts version that was already included in neteans, but after i tested  the examples 
i didnt want to use anything in my project, since i was focused to find a way to get rid of the 
scriplets for sending cookies.
Struts still was not ale to do this so i found a taglib that had exactly what i was looking for 
and i added it. I also kept the stadard jstl for some logic functions, that could e redone with 
struts <logic:> tag but the mechanism for cookie handling should be reconstructed...

The cookie sender mechanism is the same as project 3, but now instead of a scriplet 
i use a cookietag tld. It Checks if we have a request, if not it checks for cookies 
and if thats false too it inits values to 0.

I extracted the war file in my tomcat (not the netbean's one) and after 
i tested the result i deployed it at inf-server. In github i have uploaded 
the netbean's directory.
